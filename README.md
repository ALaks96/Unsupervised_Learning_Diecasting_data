# Unsupervised Learning Diecasting data

This project was the midterm of my Introduction to Machine Learning course at Ecole Polytechnique.

We were tasked to use different unsupervised learning methods (PCA, MCA, FAMD, K-Means, Hierarchical tree) to do a thorough analysis of data on decanting parts coming from various suppliers.
The data provided is typically a dataset containing many variables and very few rows, making the whole challenge of this use case. 

We were then to propose an application of supervised learning on this data given the information we retrieved via unsupervised learning.
